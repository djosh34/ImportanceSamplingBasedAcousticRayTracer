# Faster proposed method for optimal speaker location determination

## Executive summary

The objective is to identify the
sound source location that
results in the flattest
frequency response at
receiver locations, promoting
a listening experience aligned
with the artist's intention.

Acoustic ray tracing, which
can be used as a method for
determining frequency
response, experiences slow
performance due to missed
rays at the receiver.

The proposed method
improves performance by
using importance sampling
with gaussian distributions
derived from previous low ray count simulations.

However, inconsistent results
have been observed,
necessitating further research
to determine feasibility of the
method.
